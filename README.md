# 🚢 Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

Welcome aboard! 🛳️  
In this project (`titanic-ml-projet-1-3.ipynb`), we set sail on a Machine Learning adventure to predict who survived the **Titanic disaster** — using real passenger data like age, sex, ticket class, and more. 🧠

It’s one of the most famous beginner ML challenges — and for good reason: it's full of real-world messiness like missing data, noisy features, and human unpredictability.

## 🚀 What’s Inside?

- **Data Cleaning & Exploration** 🧹🔍
  - Handle missing values (Age, Cabin, Embarked).
  - Explore patterns (spoiler: women and children first? 🧑‍🧑‍🧒)

- **Feature Engineering** 🔧
  - Create new features like "FamilySize", "IsAlone", "Title" from names.
  - Convert categorical variables to numeric.
  - Normalize/scale data if necessary.

- **Model Building** 🤖
  - Test different models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, etc.
  - Use cross-validation to select the best one.
  - Tune hyperparameters for peak performance.

- **Prediction & Submission** 📝
  - Predict survival on the test set.
  - Prepare submission for Kaggle or personal evaluation.
